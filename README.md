### Adventure Game v0.1.3

#### What works?:

- working battle system, implemented leveling up
- working item show in battle.
- working early stage of using items
- fixed **magic attack**, now enemy dies after its *health* reaches 0
- use of **item** works, **weapons** are destroyed after its *durability* reaches 0, **consumables** are destroyed after use
- stats are updated after item use
- rebuilt folders structure

> TODO: stats after using item should be increased for one turn only instead of whole battle
> TODO: doctrings and other comments - *in progress*
